# US 15 - As a laboratory coordinator, I want to validate the work done by the clinical  chemistry technologist and specialist doctor

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a laboratory coordinator, I want to validate the work done by the clinical  chemistry technologist and specialist doctor.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

*Insert here any related specification and/or clarification provided by the client together with **your interpretation**. When possible, provide a link to such specifications/clarifications.*

**_From the Specifications Document_**

“To validate  the  work done, the  laboratory  coordinator  checks thechemical  test/result  and  associated diagnosis  madeand  confirms  that  everything  was  done  correctly.”

**_From the client clarifications_**

 	**Q1:** When the laboratory coordinator wants to validate a test does all the tests available show up for him or does he search using a code that identifies a specific test?
 	**A1:** The system shows all tests ready to validate (tests that already have the test registration date, the chemical analysys date and the diagnosis date registered in the system) and the laboratory coordinator selects one or more tests to mark as validated. 

 	**Q2:** What should happen to a test if either the test report or the results are invalid? Should we prompt for a redo of either process or simply erase the test?
 	**A2:** The laboratory coordinator only sees the test dates of tests that already have all dates registered in the system (test registration date, the chemical analysys date and the diagnosis date).

 	**Q3:** Should the laboratory coordinator validate the test results one by one or should he do only one validation of all of them?
 	**A3:** The coordinator can validate all or a subset of test results. The system does not show client personal information but shows all dates (test registration date, chemical analysys date and diagnosis date).

 	**Q4:** Does the laboratory coordinator choose which client's results to validate?
 	**A4:** The laboratory coordinator chooses a set of tests he wants to validate.

 	**Q5:** Does the laboratory coordinator review the work of the specialist doctor and clinical chemical technologist's work separately or both at the same time?
 	**A5:** I already answered this question.

 	**Q6:** Does the notification sent to client informing them that they have their results on the central application get sent automatically after the laboratory coordinator confirms the clinical chemistry technologist and specialist doctor's work?
 	**A6:** From the Project Description: "Once the laboratory coordinator confirms that everything was done correctly, the client receives a notification alerting that the results are already available in the central application and informing that he/she must access the application to view those results."
        
 	**Q7:** How should the laboratory coordinator choose the test to operate on, from a list of all the tests with a result and report or by inputting the code unique to a specific test?
 	**A7:** From a list of all tests that have a test registration date, a chemical analysis date and a diagnosis date.

 	**Q8:** Regarding to US 15, what information does the laboratory coordinator needs to be able do validate a test? We got from the description that it's suposed to show all dates. Should the system provide any more information?
 	**A8:** Only the dates.

 	Moreover, the system should record the validation date.

 	**Q9:** To validate a test the laboratory coordinator should validate all the test results and the test report in that specific order?
 	**A9:** Please read carefully my answers! The laboratory coordinator only sees dates of each test.

 	**Q10:** As soon as a test is validated should the system send the notification to a txt file like in sprint B?
 	**A10:** Please read carefully my answers!
 	In the Project Description we get: "Once the laboratory coordinator
 	confirms that everything was done correctly, the client receives a notification alerting that the
 	results are already available in the central application and informing that he/she must access the
 	application to view those results. The client receives the notification by SMS and e-mail. "

 	In a previous post in this forum:
 	"During the development of the Integrative Project we will not use any e-mail or SMS API services to send messages. All the e-mail and SMS messages should be written to a file with the name emailAndSMSMessages.txt. This file simulates the use of e-mail and SMS API services. "



  
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

   AC1: To validate the Tests needs have at least 1 test with the 3 dates (test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date).

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

Dependency to US14 since to validate the , US15 needs the 3 dates(test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date) that is only available after US14 is activated. 

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

- Input Data
	- Typed data: 
	- Selected data: Tests with 3 dates (test registration date, chemical analysis date and diagnosis date)
- Output Data
 	- List of Validated Tests with the corresponding Validation date
	- (In)Success of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: Starts Validating Test | ... interacting with the actor? | ValidatingWorkUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | ValidatingWorkController | Controller                             |			  		
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: Knows the registered user and their roles.  |
| 			  		 |							 | Company  | IE: knows/has its own Employees| 
| 			  		 |							 | Employee  | IE: knows its own data (e.g. email) |
| Step 2: Shows the Test with the 3 dates(test registration date, the chemical analysys date and the diagnosis date registered in the system) | ...knowing the valide test(s) to show?						 | TestStore         | By the application of the Creator (R1) it would be the "Company". But, by applying HC + LC to the "Company", this delegates that responsibility to the "TestStore"                            |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new TestStore? | Company | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Company has a Store. |
| Step 3: Selects the Test to be validated |	... finding the Test based in its Code? | TestStore | IE: adopts/records all the Test objects.                             |
| 			  		 |	... finding the Client based in the Test | Test | IE: knows client |  
| 			  		 |	... setting the Validation Date | Test | IE: changes its own data |  
| 			  		 |	... setting the Validation Time | Test | IE: changes its own data |  
| Step 4: shows Validated Test and requests confirmation |	n/a | n/a | n/a |
| Step 7: confirms the data | ...  validating Test locally | Test | IE: knows its own data |                              |    
| Step 7: confirms the data | ...  validating Test globally | ValidateWorkStore | IE: knows all the Test objects |                              |    
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new ValidateWorkStore? | Company | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Company has a Store. |  
| 			  		 |	... saving the validated Test? | ValidateWorkStore | IE: records/adopts all the Test objects |  
| 			  		 |	... sending email to client to inform that he can llok at the results? | EmailNotification | Pure Fabrication |  
| Step 8: Informs operation success | ... informing operation success? | ValidatingWorkUI | IE: responsible for user interaction |                              |                

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Test

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * ValidatingWorkUI
 * ValidatingWorkController
 * ValidateWorkStore
 * TestStore
 * EmailNotification
 *

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:**  Test of ValidateTest method, of class TestValideStore.

        t1.setDateValidTest();


        boolean expected = store.validateTest(t1);
        assertTrue(expected);
    }

**Test 2:**   Test of Save method, of class TestValideStore.
    @Test
    public void testSave(){
        List<app.domain.model.Test> list = new ArrayList<>();
        TestValideStore store = new TestValideStore(list);
